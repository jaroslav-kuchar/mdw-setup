Service Bus 10g: Problem with Pack / Unpack of Domain [ID 981068.1] 
OSB domain created with pack/unpack command doesn't work correctly. 
This is a known issue. The jar file generated by the "pack" command has to be manually changed. Please follow the instructions below: 
After creating the template, and before you create any new domains from this template, you must do the following: 
1) Add the missing files, DefaultAuthorizerInit.ldift and XACMLAuthorizerInit.ldift, from the DOMAIN-ROOT/security folder of your original domain to the security folder inside the template JAR (jar file generated by the pack command).
2) Manually update the top-level security.xml file in the template JAR with the contents of the DOMAIN-ROOT/init-info/security.xml file of your original domain. 

jar -xf myfile.jar
copy files and overwrite all lines from line 39
jar -cf myfile.jar ./
